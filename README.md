# LibraryApp

A Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 Library App for managing and browsing books, with decade grouping, add modal, and full API integration.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC.01: Display a list of books on the homepage**
  - [x] AC.01.1: The list of books must be fetched from the provided API (see `.env.example`).
  - [x] AC.01.2: Books are categorized into 10-year intervals based on their publishedYear, from most recent to oldest.
  - [x] AC.01.3: If no books are published within a specific 10-year interval, display "No publications" for that range.
  - [x] AC.01.4: If consecutive 10-year intervals have no publications, combine these intervals and display "No publications" for the combined range.
  - [x] AC.01.5: Within each decade, books are displayed in descending order, from most recent to oldest.
- [x] **AC.02: Book Addition Modal**
  - [x] AC.02.1: The Home Page includes an "Add a Book" button that opens a modal.
  - [x] AC.02.2: The modal contains a form with fields for title, author, publishedYear, genre, and ratings.
  - [x] AC.02.3: All fields are mandatory except for ratings, which can be left empty.
  - [x] AC.02.4: The form validates all mandatory fields before submission.
  - [x] AC.02.5: On successful submission, a POST request is made to the API, the modal closes, and the new book appears in the correct decade.
